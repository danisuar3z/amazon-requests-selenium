# amazon-requests-selenium
My first project, created from scratch
Python 3.8.5

I know there's a bunch of tools and software that already do this, but I wanted
to put to the test my learning and create an Amazon US price scraper.

The script tries to fetch the prices with requests module and if it fails, it
will use the webdriver from Selenium instead for those failed prices.

I'll update this with the "How to use" later...
